# AI-Driven-Plant-Disease-Prediction-and-Management-System
üìù Project Description
Agriculture plays a vital role in global food production and economic stability. One of the key challenges faced by farmers and agricultural professionals is the early and accurate detection of plant leaf diseases, which, if left untreated, can severely affect crop yield and quality. Traditional disease identification methods rely heavily on manual inspection by experts, which is not only time-consuming and costly but also prone to human error ‚Äî especially in large-scale farming.

This project introduces an intelligent and automated solution for plant disease detection using deep learning. The core of the system is the EfficientNetB4 model, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network known for its high performance and efficiency. We utilize transfer learning to fine-tune this pretrained model on a labeled dataset of plant leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset.

üöÄ What the Project Does
Classifies plant leaf images into multiple disease categories or marks them as healthy.

Uses image preprocessing and data augmentation to improve training efficiency.

Applies EfficientNetB4 with custom dense layers to adapt the model to our classification task.

Outputs a disease label and a confidence score for each prediction.

Provides a scalable, real-time solution that can be deployed via web or mobile applications.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

Model: EfficientNetB4 (from TensorFlow Hub)

Dataset: PlantVillage (Mendeley Data)

Tools: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook, TensorBoard

üîç Workflow
Image Collection: Healthy and diseased leaf images collected from the PlantVillage dataset.

Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, and augment images to improve model generalization.

Model Building: Load pretrained EfficientNetB4, add custom classification layers.

Training: Fine-tune the model on labeled images using categorical crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer.

Prediction: Classify unseen images with output in the form of disease name + confidence score.

üìà Results
Achieved over 93% validation accuracy on multiclass classification of plant leaf diseases.

Successfully predicted various diseases including bacterial, fungal, and viral infections in crops like tomato, potato, corn, etc.

üí° Key Features
Highly accurate predictions using transfer learning

Efficient model suitable for mobile/web deployment

User-friendly: Just upload a leaf image to get diagnosis

Can assist farmers with early disease detection, saving crops and resources

üåç Future Scope
Deploy the model as a mobile app or web dashboard for real-time usage by farmers.

Expand the dataset with real-world farm images captured in natural lighting.

Integrate with IoT sensors or drones for large-scale crop monitoring.

Improve the system to detect multiple diseases in a single leaf or handle partially damaged leaves.
